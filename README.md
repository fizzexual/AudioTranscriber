## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11
- **Python**: 3.10 or higher
- **GPU** (Optional): NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support for faster processing
- **Microphone**: Any working audio input device

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/audio-transcriber.git
cd audio-transcriber
```

### Step 2: Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Required packages:**
- `openai-whisper` - Whisper AI model
- `torch` - PyTorch framework
- `pyaudio` - Audio capture
- `soundfile` - Audio file handling
- `scipy` - Signal processing
- `numpy` - Numerical operations

### Step 3: Install PyTorch with GPU Support (Recommended)

For **NVIDIA GPU users** (10-20x faster):

```bash
# Run the automated installer
.\Helpers\install_pytorch_gpu_auto.bat
```

Or manually:
```bash
pip uninstall -y torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

For **CPU-only** (slower but works on any system):
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation

```bash
python test_microphone.py
```

This will test your microphone and verify all dependencies are correctly installed.

## 💻 Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Launch the application:**
   ```bash
   python audio_transcriber_whisper_local.py
   ```

2. **Select your model size:**
   - `tiny` - 40MB, fastest, good for quick notes
   - `base` - 140MB, balanced speed and accuracy (recommended)
   - `small` - 460MB, better accuracy
   - `medium` - 1.5GB, high accuracy
   - `large` - 3GB, best accuracy

3. **Choose your device:**
   - `auto` - Automatically uses GPU if available
   - `cpu` - Force CPU processing
   - `cuda` - Force GPU processing

4. **Click "Load Model"** - First time will download the model

5. **Select your microphone** from the dropdown

6. **Click "Start Listening"** and begin speaking

7. **Watch real-time transcription** appear in the text area

### Model Selection Guide

| Model  | Size   | Speed      | Accuracy | Best For                    |
|--------|--------|------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| tiny   | 40MB   | Very Fast  | Good     | Quick notes, testing        |
| base   | 140MB  | Fast       | Good     | General use (recommended)   |
| small  | 460MB  | Medium     | Better   | Professional transcription  |
| medium | 1.5GB  | Slow       | High     | High-accuracy needs         |
| large  | 3GB    | Very Slow  | Best     | Maximum accuracy required   |

### Performance Benchmarks

**With NVIDIA RTX 4060 GPU:**
- tiny: ~0.5s per 5s audio chunk
- base: ~1s per 5s audio chunk
- small: ~2s per 5s audio chunk

**With CPU (Intel i7):**
- tiny: ~3s per 5s audio chunk
- base: ~8s per 5s audio chunk
- small: ~20s per 5s audio chunk

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Chunk Duration

Adjust the slider to control recording intervals:
- **3-5 seconds**: Faster response, may cut off words
- **5-7 seconds**: Balanced (recommended)
- **8-10 seconds**: Better accuracy, slower response

### Language Settings

- **Auto**: Automatic language detection (recommended)
- **Manual**: Select specific language for better accuracy

Supported languages include: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, Turkish, Polish, Ukrainian, and 86 more.

### GPU Configuration

The application automatically detects and uses your GPU. To verify:

```bash
python -c "import torch; print('CUDA Available:', torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

If `False`, reinstall PyTorch with CUDA support using the helper script.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No microphone detected"
- Check microphone permissions in Windows Settings
- Ensure microphone is set as default recording device
- Try running `test_microphone.py` to diagnose

#### "CUDA not available" (GPU not detected)
- Verify you have an NVIDIA GPU
- Install/update NVIDIA drivers
- Reinstall PyTorch with CUDA: `.\Helpers\install_pytorch_gpu_auto.bat`

#### "Model loading failed"
- Check internet connection (first download only)
- Ensure sufficient disk space (models are 40MB-3GB)
- Try a smaller model size

#### "Transcription error: [WinError 2]"
- This has been fixed in the latest version
- Update to the latest code if you see this error

#### Slow transcription on CPU
- This is normal - CPU processing is 10-20x slower than GPU
- Consider using a smaller model (tiny or base)
- Upgrade to GPU-enabled PyTorch for better performance
